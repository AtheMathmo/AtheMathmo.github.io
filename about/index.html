<h2>I'm James.</h2>
<p>I am currently a PhD student in the machine learning group at the University of Toronto.</p>
<p>I finished my BA in Mathematics at the University of Cambridge, in 2015.
My interests include (but are not limited to) Statistics, Probability Theory, and Machine Learning.
In the summers of 2014 and 2015 I undertook internships at Microsoft Research, Cambridge in the
Machine Learning and Perception group.</p>
<p>In 2016 I lived in San Francisco and worked as a software engineer for LoopUp.</p>
<p>In my free time I enjoy rock climbing, running and building <a href="https://github.com/AtheMathmo/rusty-machine">rusty-machine</a> (among other things).</p>
