<h2>I'm James.</h2>
<p>I finished my BA in Mathematics at the University of Cambridge, in 2015. My interests include (but are not limited to) Statistics, Probability Theory, and Machine Learning. In the summers of 2014 and 2015 I undertook internships at Microsoft Research, Cambridge in the Machine Learning and Perception group.</p>
<p>I am now living in San Francisco and working as a software engineer at LoopUp.</p>
<p>In my free time I enjoy rock climbing, running and building [rusty-machine](https://github.com/AtheMathmo/rusty-machine) (among other things).</p>
